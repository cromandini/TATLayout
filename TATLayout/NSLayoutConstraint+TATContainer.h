 This category in `NSLayoutConstraint` adds support for calculating the closest ancestor shared by the views participating as well as for weakly associating the container of the constraint. The association is used to cache the container in order to avoid inspecting the view hierarchy more than one time when the constraint is activated-deactivated.
